## Data and Code for:

###### WARMER NEST TEMPERATURES REDUCE HATCHING RATES OF A COOL-ADAPTED, MIGRATORY SONGBIRD AT ITS TRAILING-EDGE RANGE BOUNDARY  

This repository contains the data and R scripts required to recreated the analyses in the paper, including:

1. **Egg translocation manipulation data**

            -Translocation_Analysis.R
            -Translocation_Data.gzip
            
3. **Female effort data**



4. **Internal and external (ambient) nest temperature data**



5. **Nestling measurement data**



6. **Rangewide hatch rate data for black-throated blue warblers in the Nantahala National Forest and at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest**

            -BTBW_rangewide_analysis.R
            -rangedata.gzip


From R, you can load each dataset with the command load()
The different analyses are available in separate r-scripts.

# Egg_Translocation
Data and Code for:

WARMER NEST TEMPERATURES REDUCE HATCHING RATES OF A COOL-ADAPTED, MIGRATORY SONGBIRD AT ITS TRAILING-EDGE RANGE BOUNDARY  

The file Egg_Translocation-data.gzip contains the data required to recreated the analyses in the paper, including:

1. Egg translocation manipulation data

-rangedata.gzip

3. Internal and external (ambient) nest temperature data
4. Female effort data
5. Nestling measurement data
6. Rangewide hatch rate data for black-throated blue warblers in the Nantahala National Forest and at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.

From R, you can load each dataset with the command load()

The different analyses are available in separate r-scripts.

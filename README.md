# Egg_Translocation
Data and Code for:

WARMER NEST TEMPERATURES REDUCE HATCHING RATES OF A COOL-ADAPTED, MIGRATORY SONGBIRD AT ITS TRAILING-EDGE RANGE BOUNDARY  

The file Egg_Translocation-data.gzip contains the data required to recreated the analyses in the paper, including:

1. Egg translocation manipulation data
2. Internal and external (ambient) nest temperature data
3. Female effort data
4. Nestling measurement data
5. Rangewide hatch rate data for black-throated blue warblers in the Nantahala National Forest and at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.

From R, you can load the data with the command load("Egg_Translocation-data.gzip").

The different analyses are available in separate r-scripts.
